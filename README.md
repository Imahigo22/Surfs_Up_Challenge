# Surfs_Up_Challenge
The idea in this challenge is that this company is going to open up a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The goal here is to see if we can sustain an ice cream shop all year round.  So in order ot figure this out, we must compare the temperatures in the hot month of June, and then look at the temperatures in the cold month of December and draw our conclusion from there on out.

What I ended up doing is extracting the data from sqlalchemy and then use a query to filter the data that I need.  Then I later converted it into a pandas dataframe.  So then I used the describe function to get all the statistical information from the tables.  So, by doing that I was able to conclude that we can have an ice cream shop all year round.  The temperatures from June were all pretty similiar to the December temperatures, thus it will not put a dent in our ice cream sales.

We can get more data and information throughout the days by possibly pulling from other sources.  We can check The Weather Channel, The National Weather Service, and Accuweather.  We can take notes and compare the data we have.
